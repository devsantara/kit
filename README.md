## Unlock Rapid Development & Flawless Execution

Building a great product often starts with a robust foundation. But setting up new projects from scratch can be a time-consuming and repetitive process, often leading to inconsistent configurations, missed best practices, and wasted development hours. You deserve to focus on innovation, not boilerplate.

That's where **`@devsantara/kit`** comes in. It's more than just a template; it's a meticulously crafted, opinionated boilerplate designed to give developers like you a significant head start. We've baked in **well-thought-out setups, easy maintenance, and up-to-date tooling** so you can jump straight into building your next big idea with confidence and speed.
